<IMG SRC="alunanresort.jpg" height="450px" width="500px">
<p>There are only a handful of hotels & resorts at Pulau Perhentian Kecil, and Alunan Resort is arguably the best resort on the island. <br>It is a pretty small island and Alunan Resort is on the quiet side of the island.<center>

<p>Getting to Pulau Perhentian Kecil involves some challenges for first timers. Get yourself to Kuala Besut jetty, park your car, ride a boat, and voila! You will find yourself on an unspoiled island surrounded by pristine beach.
